    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <p>
      I am graduating this year with a degree in Information Technology and have
      developed a strong foundation in computer systems, troubleshooting, and
      technical support. Through my academic coursework and hands-on experience,
      I have gained practical knowledge working with hardware, operating systems,
      and basic networking concepts.
    </p>

    <p>
      I am CompTIA A+ certified and have over two years of IT experience supporting
      users, diagnosing technical issues, and maintaining reliable systems.
      I am passionate about technology, eager to continue learning, and motivated
      to grow as an IT professional in a fast-paced and collaborative environment.
